title: "Japanese ACE Setup"
---
Here you can find tutorials for setting up ACE in Japanese FireRed and LeafGreen. There is not much choice for native ACE in this language as the mail glitch modifies a portion of Pokémon data that is more difficult to manipulate.

*   [Main Route](./jpn-ace.md)
    +   This is the original route that can be used to setup ACE as demonstrated in Detelony’s video tutorial/explanation. This has been adapted to English in written form.
*   [ニドくん Route](./jpn-lg-ace.md)
    +   This method is an easier route for people who are able to access the trade Pokémon ニドくん, which is only natively available on LeafGreen version.
    +   Unfortunately there is no trade Pokémon that is natively available on FireRed that have the correct arrangement of data to allow for an ACE route to be developed around it, and thus limiting this method to LeafGreen or copies of FireRed with this trade Pokémon traded from LeafGreen.
